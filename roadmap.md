ðŸ§  Account Monitoring Agent â€“ Step-by-Step Guide
1. Define the Agentâ€™s Purpose
Monitor a curated list of X accounts and keep a rotating cache of their 3 most recent tweets in Supabase.

2. Set Up the Database
You need two core tables:

x_accounts
Stores the accounts you're monitoring.

Fields to include: id, handle, platform, priority, last_checked.

tweets_cache
Stores the last 3 tweets for each person.

Fields: id, person_id, tweet_id, tweet_text, tweet_url, created_at, fetched_at.

3. Build the Account List
Populate the x_accounts table with:

X usernames (handle)

Priority level (e.g. 1 for high-engagement accounts)

Platform (x)

Last checked time (can be null initially)

4. Schedule the Agent
Determine how frequently it runs:

e.g. Every 2 hours

Use a cron job, Supabase Edge Function schedule, or serverless platform like Vercel/Cron, or a background queue

5. Fetch Data from X
For each account:

Call the X API (or scrape as backup) to retrieve the 3 most recent tweets

Sort by created_at, discard retweets/replies if desired

6. Compare with Existing Cached Tweets
Look up existing entries in tweets_cache for this person_id

Check if tweet IDs match

If unchanged: update last_checked only

If different: delete old tweets â†’ insert new ones

7. Save to Supabase
Insert new tweet data into tweets_cache

Update fetched_at and created_at timestamps

Update last_checked in x_accounts table

8. Handle API/Rate Limits
Add pause or delay between requests

Optionally prioritize based on the priority field in x_accounts

9. Logging & Monitoring
Log each account scan (success or fail)

Track rate limit hits, errors, or downtime

Optionally log agent heartbeat for observability

10. Test the Flow End-to-End
Run on a small batch of accounts

Check if:

Only 3 tweets are stored

Old tweets are removed correctly

No duplication

last_checked updates

11. Optional Enhancements (For Later)
Tag tweets with categories, sentiment, or keywords

Track engagement attempts from other agents

Add caching layer to reduce API calls

Build dashboard to view tweet cache + agent logs
